# Recognize the gender of German nouns through neural networks. 

There's a loose set of rules that defines the gender, generally based upon the word ending, although in some cases it ends up being totally random. 

The idea is to try and implement it with both a convolutional NN and a recursive NN to see the differences better, even though I know recursive NNs are generally the better suited ones for text classification.
